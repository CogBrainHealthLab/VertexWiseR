## Installing VertexWiseR and checking for requirements

The following code installs the package and makes sure all requirements, prompting the user to install dependencies, in order to allow analyses to work.

```{r, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
install.packages("VertexWiseR") 
```

```{r, results = 'hide'}
library(VertexWiseR)
```

VWRfirstrun() checks all system requiremements for specific functions, and gives the opportunity to download and install each of them.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
VWRfirstrun()
```

## Example analysis 1: linear model of age and cortical thickness, and meta-analytic decoding

The analysis will use surface data already extracted in R from a preprocessed subjects directory, which we make available so you do not need to preprocess a sample yourself. To obtain it, we had extracted cortical thickness (CT) data from a FreeSurfer preprocessing directory of the [SPRENG dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003592/versions/1.0.13) [@spreng_neurocognitive_2022]. 

The demo data (218 MB) required to run the package demos can be downloaded from the package's github repository with the following function:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#This will save the demo_data directory in a temporary directory (tempdir(), but you can change it to your own path)
demodata=VertexWiseR:::dl_demo(path=tempdir(), quiet=TRUE)
```

Here is the command line which was originally used to extract the surface:

```{r}

#SURFvextract(sdirpath = SUBJECTS_DIR, filename = "SPRENG_CTv", template='fsaverage5', measure = 'thickness', subj_ID = T)

```

To load the demo thickness matrix:

```{r, envir=globalenv()}
SPRENG_CTv = readRDS(file=paste0(demodata,"/SPRENG_CTv_site1.rds"))
```

To smooth the surface data:

```{r}
SPRENG_CTv_smoothed = smooth_surf(SPRENG_CTv, 10)
```

To load the demo behavioural data (for participants in site 1, SPRENG_behdata_site1.csv):

```{r}
dat_beh=readRDS(paste0(demodata,'/SPRENG_behdata_site1.rds'))
```

To run the vertex-wise model analysis with random field theory-based cluster correction, testing for the effect of age, controlling for sex, on CT:

```{r, results = 'hide'}
model1_RFT=RFT_vertex_analysis(model = dat_beh[,c("sex","age")], 
  contrast = dat_beh[,"age"], surf_data = SPRENG_CTv_smoothed, p = 0.05)
```

```{r}
model1_RFT$cluster_level_results
```

To run the vertex-wise model analysis with threshold-free cluster enhancement-based cluster correction, testing for the effect of age, controlling for sex, on CT; with 1000 permutations:

```{r, results = 'hide'}

model1_TFCE=TFCE_vertex_analysis(model= dat_beh[,c("sex","age")], 
                                 contrast = dat_beh[,"age"],
                                 surf_data=SPRENG_CTv_smoothed,
                                 nperm=1000, 
                                 nthread=4) 

TFCEoutput = TFCE_threshold(model1_TFCE, p=0.05)
```

```{r}
TFCEoutput$cluster_level_results
```

To plot the results of both models on an inflated fsaverage5 surface:

```{r, results = 'hide'}
tmaps = rbind(model1_RFT$thresholded_tstat_map, TFCEoutput$thresholded_tstat_map)
plot_surf(surf_data = tmaps, 
          filename ='SPRENG_tstatmaps.png', 
          surface = 'inflated', 
          title=c("RFT-corrected\nclusters", "TFCE-corrected\nclusters"),
          cmap='RdBu_r',
          show.plot.window=FALSE)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%", fig.alt="Significant clusters after RFT correction and TFCE correction"}
knitr::include_graphics('SPRENG_tstatmaps.png')
```

To run meta-analytic decoding of the significant negative clusters (the neurosynth dataset needs to be installed as VWRfirstrun() allows):

```{r,results = 'hide'}
surf_decoding=decode_surf_data(TFCEoutput$thresholded_tstat_map, contrast="negative")
```

```{r}
head(surf_decoding)
```
