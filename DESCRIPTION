Description: Provides functions to run statistical analyses on
    surface-based neuroimaging data, computing measures including cortical
    thickness and surface area of the whole-brain and of the hippocampi.
    It can make use of Freesurfer preprocessed datasets and Hippunfold
    hippocampal segmentation outputs for a given sample by restructuring
    the data values into a single file. The single file can then be used
    by the package for analyses independently from its base dataset and
    without need for its access.
