\title{Threshold-free cluster enhancement (single core)}
\usage{
TFCE(data, tail = tail)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame object containing the variables to include in the model at each column, and rows of values assigned to each participant.}

\item{tail}{A numeric integer object stating whether the t-test is one-sided (1) or two-sided (2) model}
}
\value{
A list object containing permuted TFCE statistics
}
\description{
Estimates clusters with threshold-free cluster enhancement from whole-brain and hippocampal surface t-statistics map, when only one cpu core is allocated.
}
\details{
The TFCE method for estimating unpermuted TFCE statistics is adapted from the \href{https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/main/nilearn/mass_univariate/_utils.py#L7C8-L7C8}{nilearn python library}.
}
\examples{
TFCE(data = tmap,tail = 2)
