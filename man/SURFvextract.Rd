\usage{
SURFvextract(
  sdirpath,
  filename,
  template = "fsaverage5",
  measure = "thickness",
  subj_ID = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sdirpath}{A string object containing the path to the Freesurfer subjects directory.}

\item{filename}{A string object containing the desired name of the output RDS file.}

\item{template}{A string object containing the name of surface template (available: 'fsaverage5', 'fsaverage6'). Default is fsaverage5.}

\item{measure}{A string object containing the name of the measure of interest. Options are thickness, curv, sulc, area. Default is thickness.}

\item{subj_ID}{A logical object stating whether to include subject IDs (folder names in the subjects directory) as a first column to the output matrix. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A .rds file with a list containing 1 the list of subject IDs and 2 a surface data matrix object. The matrix can be used independently by VertexWiseR statistical analysis functions. Each row corresponds to a subject (in the same order as 1) and contains the left to right hemispheres' vertex-wise values.
}
\description{
Extracts whole-brain vertex-wise surface-based measures for each subject in a Freesurfer output subjects directory, resamples the data to a common surface template, and stores it into a single matrix. This function requires the Freesurfer environment to be preset.
}
\details{
The function runs system shell commands that will produce in the set subjects directory: 1) a sorted list of subjects "sublist.txt"; 2) a link file to the selected surface fsaverage template. 3) left and right hemisphere .mgh maps outputted by FreeSurfer's mris_preproc.
